# Homework Solution to Machine Learning 

This repo contains my own solutions to the programming exercises in the awesome [Machine Learing course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) on Coursera taught by Andrew Ng.

For simplicity's sake, I did not include:
- The instruction documents
- Data sets
- Scripts related to homework submissions

Happy coding and happy machine learning!
